      "Charlemagne ( ; 2 April 748 – 28 January 814) was King of the Franks from 768, King of the Lombards from 774, and Emperor of what is now known as the Carolingian Empire from 800, holding these titles until his death in 814. He united most of Western and Central Europe, and was the first recognised emperor to rule from the west after the fall of the Western Roman Empire approximately three centuries earlier. Charlemagne's reign was marked by political and social changes that had lasting influence on Europe throughout the Middle Ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "A member of the Frankish Carolingian dynasty, Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon. With his brother, Carloman I, he became king of the Franks in 768 following Pepin's death and became the sole ruler three years later. Charlemagne continued his father's policy of protecting the papacy and became its chief defender, removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy in 774. His reign saw a period of expansion that led to the conquests of Bavaria, Saxony, and northern Spain, as well as other campaigns that led Charlemagne to extend his rule over a large part of Europe. Charlemagne spread Christianity to his new conquests (often by force), as seen at the Massacre of Verden against the Saxons. He also sent envoys and initiated diplomatic contact with the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 790s, due to their mutual interest in Iberian affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III. Although historians debate the coronation's significance, the title represented the height of his prestige and authority. Charlemagne's position as the first emperor in the West in over 300 years brought him into conflict with the Eastern Roman Empire in Constantinople. Through his assumption of the imperial title, he is considered the forerunner to the line of Holy Roman Emperors, which persisted into the nineteenth century. As king and emperor, Charlemagne engaged in a number of reforms in administration, law, education, military organisation, and religion, which shaped Europe for centuries. The stability of his reign began a period of cultural activity known as the Carolingian Renaissance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne died in 814 and was buried at Aachen Cathedral in Aachen, his imperial capital city. He was succeeded by his only surviving legitimate son, Louis the Pious. After Louis, the Frankish kingdom was divided and eventually coalesced into West and East Francia, which later became France and Germany, respectively. Charlemagne's profound influence on the Middle Ages and influence on the territory he ruled has led him to be called the \"Father of Europe\" by many historians. He is seen as a founding figure by multiple European states and a number of historical royal houses of Europe trace their lineage back to him. Charlemagne has been the subject of artworks, monuments and literature during and after the medieval period and is venerated by the Catholic Church.\n",

      "\n",
      "Several languages were spoken in Charlemagne's world, but he used  (or ) in Medieval Latin, the formal language of writing and diplomacy.   Charles is the modern English form of these names. The name , as the emperor is normally known in English, comes from the French  ('Charles the Great').  In modern German and Dutch, he is known as  and   respectively.  The Latin epithet  ('great') may have been associated with him during his lifetime, but this is not certain. The contemporary Royal Frankish Annals routinely call him  (\"Charles the great king\").  That epithet is attested in the works of the Poeta Saxo around 900, and it had become commonly applied to him by 1000. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne was named after his grandfather, Charles Martel.  That name, and its derivatives, are unattested before their use by Charles Martel and Charlemagne.  Karolus was adapted by Slavic languages as their word for \"king\" (,  and ) through Charlemagne's influence or that of his great-grandson, Charles the Fat. \n",

      "By the sixth century, the western Germanic tribe of the Franks had been Christianised; this was due in considerable measure to the conversion of their king, Clovis I, to Catholicism.  The Franks had established a kingdom in Gaul in the wake of the Fall of the Western Roman Empire.  This kingdom, Francia, grew to encompass nearly all of present-day France and Switzerland, along with parts of modern Germany and the Low Countries under the rule of the Merovingian dynasty.  Francia was often divided under different Merovingian kings, due to the partible inheritance practised by the Franks.  The late seventh century saw a period of war and instability following the murder of King Childeric II, which led to factional struggles among the Frankish aristocrats. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pepin of Herstal, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, ended the strife between various kings and their mayors with his 687 victory at the Battle of Tertry.  Pepin was the grandson of two important figures of Austrasia: Arnulf of Metz and Pepin of Landen.  The mayors of the palace had gained influence as the Merovingian kings' power waned due to divisions of the kingdom and several succession crises.  Pepin was eventually succeeded by his son Charles, later known as Charles Martel.  Charles did not support a Merovingian successor upon the death of King Theuderic IV in 737, leaving the throne vacant.  He made plans to divide the kingdom between his sons, Carloman and Pepin the Short, who succeeded him after his death in 741.  The brothers placed the Merovingian Childeric III on the throne in 743.  Pepin married Bertrada, a member of an influential Austrasian noble family, in 744.   In 747, Carloman abdicated and entered a monastery in Rome. He had at least two sons; the elder, Drogo, took his place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Subsection: Birth\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne's year of birth is uncertain, although it was most likely in 748.     An older tradition based on three sources, however, gives a birth year of 742. The ninth-century biographer Einhard reports Charlemagne as being 72 years old at the time of his death; the Royal Frankish Annals imprecisely gives his age at death as about 71, and his original epitaph called him a septuagenarian.  Einhard said that he did not know much about Charlemagne's early life; some modern scholars believe that, not knowing the emperor's true age, he still sought to present an exact date in keeping with the Roman imperial biographies of Suetonius, which he used as a model.   All three sources may have been influenced by Psalm 90: \"The days of our years are threescore years and ten\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Historian Karl Ferdinand Werner challenged the acceptance of 742 as the Frankish king's birth year, citing an addition to the Annales Petaviani which records Charlemagne's birth in 747.  Lorsch Abbey commemorated Charlemagne's date of birth as 2 April from the mid-ninth century, and this date is likely to be genuine.   Matthias Becher built on Werner's work and showed that 2 April in the year recorded would have actually been in 748, since the annalists recorded the start of the year from Easter rather than 1 January.  Presently, most scholars accept April 748 for Charlemagne's birth.    Charlemagne's place of birth is unknown. The Frankish palaces in Vaires-sur-Marne and Quierzy are among the places suggested by scholars.  Pepin the Short held an assembly in Düren in 748, but it cannot be proved that it took place in April or if Bertrada was with him. \n",

      "The  (\"native tongue\").  that Einhard refers to with regard to Charlemagne, was a Germanic language.   Due to the prevalence in Francia of \"rustic Roman\", he was probably functionally bilingual in Germanic and Romance dialects at an early age.  Charlemagne also spoke Latin and, according to Einhard, could understand and (perhaps) speak some Greek.  Some 19th century historians tried to use the Oaths of Strasbourg (842) to determine Charlemagne's native language. They assumed that the text's copyist, Nithard, being a grandson of Charlemagne, would have spoken the same dialect as his grandfather, giving rise to the assumption that Charlemagne would have spoken language closely related to the one used in the oath, which is a form of Old High German ancestral to the modern Rhenish Franconian dialects. \n",
      "   Other authors have instead taken Charlemagne's place of birth (Liege, Belgium) and the place of his education and main residence (Aachen), to postulate that Charlemagne most likely spoke a form of Moselle- or Ripuarian Franconian.  In any case, all three dialects would have been closely related, mutually intelligible and, while classified as Old High German, none of the dialects involved can be considered typical of Old High German, showing varying degrees of participation in the High German consonant shift as well as certain similarities with Old Dutch, the presumed language of the previous Merovingian dynasty, mirroring the linguistic diversity still typical of the region today.     \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne's father Pepin had been educated at the abbey of Saint-Denis, although the extent of Charlemagne's formal education is unknown.  He almost certainly was trained in military matters as a youth in Pepin's court,  which was itinerant.  Charlemagne also asserted his own education in the liberal arts in encouraging their study by his children and others, although it is unknown whether his study was as a child or at court during his later life.  The question of Charlemagne's literacy is debated, with little direct evidence from contemporary sources. He normally had texts read aloud to him and dictated responses and decrees, but this was not unusual even for a literate ruler at the time.  Historian Johannes Fried considers it likely that Charlemagne would have been able to read,  but the medievalist Paul Dutton writes that \"the evidence for his ability to read is circumstantial and inferential at best\"  and concludes that it is likely that he never properly mastered the skill.  Einhard makes no direct mention of Charlemagne reading, and recorded that he only attempted to learn to write later in life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Subsection: Accession and reign with Carloman\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only occasional references to Charlemagne in the Frankish annals during his father's lifetime.  By 751 or 752, Pepin had deposed Childeric and replaced him as king.  Early Carolingian-influenced sources claim that Pepin's seizure of the throne was sanctioned beforehand by Pope Stephen II,  but modern historians dispute this.   It is possible that papal approval came only when Stephen travelled to Francia in 754 (apparently to request Pepin's aid against the Lombards), and on this trip anointed Pepin as king; this legitimised his rule.   Charlemagne was sent to greet and escort the Pope, and he and his younger brother Carloman were anointed with their father.  Pepin sidelined Drogo around the same time, sending him and his brother to a monastery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne began issuing charters in his own name in 760. The following year, he joined his father's campaign against Aquitaine.  Aquitaine, led by Dukes Hunald and Waiofar, was constantly in rebellion during Pepin's reign.  Pepin fell ill on campaign there and died on 24 September 768, and Charlemagne and Carloman succeeded their father.  They had separate coronations, Charlemagne at Noyon and Carloman at Soissons, on 9 October.  The brothers maintained separate palaces and spheres of influence, although they were considered joint rulers of a single Frankish kingdom.  The Royal Frankish Annals report that Charlemagne ruled Austrasia and Carloman ruled Burgundy, Provence, Aquitaine, and Alamannia, with no mention made of which brother received Neustria.  The immediate concern of the brothers was the ongoing uprising in Aquitaine.  They marched into Aquitaine together, but Carloman returned to Francia for unknown reasons and Charlemagne completed the campaign on his own.  Charlemagne's capture of Duke Hunald marked the end of ten years of war that had been waged in the attempt to bring Aquitaine into line. \n",
      "\n",
      "Carloman's refusal to participate in the war against Aquitaine led to a rift between the kings.   It is uncertain why Carloman abandoned the campaign; the brothers may have disagreed about control of the territory,   or Carloman was focused on securing his rule in the north of Francia.  Regardless of the strife between the kings, they maintained a joint rule for practical reasons.  Charlemagne and Carloman worked to obtain the support of the clergy and local elites to solidify their positions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pope Stephen III was elected in 768, but was briefly deposed by Antipope Constantine II before being restored to Rome.  Stephen's papacy experienced continuing factional struggles, so he sought support from the Frankish kings.  Both brothers sent troops to Rome, each hoping to exert his own influence.  The Lombard king Desiderius also had interests in Roman affairs, and Charlemagne attempted to enlist him as an ally.  Desiderius already had alliances with Bavaria and Benevento through the marriages of his daughters to their dukes,  and an alliance with Charlemagne would add to his influence.  Charlemagne's mother, Bertrada, went on his behalf to Lombardy in 770 and brokered a marriage alliance before returning to Francia with his new bride.  Desiderius's daughter is traditionally known as Desiderata, although she may have been named Gerperga.   Anxious about the prospect of a Frankish–Lombard alliance, Pope Stephen sent a letter to both Frankish kings decrying the marriage and separately sought closer ties with Carloman. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne had already had a relationship with the Frankish noblewoman Himiltrude, and they had a son in 769 named Pepin.  Paul the Deacon wrote in his 784  that Pepin was born \"before legal marriage\", but does not say whether Charles and Himiltrude ever married, were joined in a non-canonical marriage (), or married after Pepin was born.  Pope Stephen's letter described the relationship as a legitimate marriage, but he had a vested interest in preventing Charlemagne from marrying Desiderius's daughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Carloman died suddenly on 4 December 771, leaving Charlemagne sole king of the Franks.  He moved immediately to secure his hold on his brother's territory, forcing Carloman's widow Gerberga to flee to Desiderius's court in Lombardy with their children.   Charlemagne ended his marriage to Desiderius's daughter and married Hildegard, daughter of count Gerold, a powerful magnate in Carloman's kingdom.  This was a reaction to Desiderius's sheltering of Carloman's family  and a move to secure Gerold's support.  \n",

The success of the war helped secure Charlemagne's reputation among his brother's former supporters and funded further military action.  The campaign was the beginning of over thirty years of nearly-continuous warfare against the Saxons by Charlemagne. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pope Adrian I succeeded Stephen III in 772, and sought the return of papal control of cities that had been captured by Desiderius.  Unsuccessful in dealing with the Lombard king directly, Adrian sent emissaries to Charlemagne to gain his support for recovering papal territory. Charlemagne, in response to this appeal and the dynastic threat of Carloman's sons in the Lombard court, gathered his forces to intervene.  He first sought a diplomatic solution, offering gold to Desiderius in exchange for the return of the papal territories and his nephews.  This overture was rejected, and Charlemagne's army (commanded by himself and his uncle, Bernard) crossed the Alps to besiege the Lombard capital of Pavia in late 773. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne's second son (also named Charles) was born in 772, and Charlemagne brought the child and his wife to the camp at Pavia. Hildegard was pregnant, and gave birth to a daughter named Adelhaid. The baby was sent back to Francia, but died on the way.  Charlemagne left Bernard to maintain the siege at Pavia while he took a force to capture Verona, where Desiderius's son Adalgis had taken Carloman's sons.  Charlemagne captured the city; no further record exists of his nephews or of Carloman's wife, and their fate is unknown.   Recent biographer, Janet Nelson compares them to the Princes in the Tower in the Wars of the Roses.  Fried suggests that the boys were forced into a monastery (a common solution of dynastic issues), or \"an act of murder smooth[ed] Charlemagne's ascent to power.\"  Adalgis was not captured by Charlemagne, and fled to Constantinople. \n",

Pope Adrian arranged a formal welcome for the Frankish king, and they swore oaths to each other over the relics of St. Peter.  Adrian presented a copy of the agreement between Pepin and Stephen III outlining the papal lands and rights Pepin had agreed to protect and restore.  It is unclear which lands and rights the agreement involved, which remained a point of dispute for centuries.  Charlemagne placed a copy of the agreement in the chapel above St. Peter's tomb as a symbol of his commitment, and left Rome to continue the siege. \n",

      "Disease struck the Lombards shortly after his return to Pavia, and they surrendered the city by June 774.  Charlemagne deposed Desiderius and took the title of King of the Lombards.  The takeover of one kingdom by another was \"extraordinary\",  and the authors of The Carolingian World call it \"without parallel\".  Charlemagne secured the support of the Lombard nobles and Italian urban elites to seize power in a mainly-peaceful annexation.   Historian Rosamond McKitterick suggests that the elective nature of the Lombard monarchy eased Charlemagne's takeover,  and Roger Collins attributes the easy conquest to the Lombard elite's \"presupposition that rightful authority was in the hands of the one powerful enough to seize it\".  Charlemagne soon returned to Francia with the Lombard royal treasury and with Desiderius and his family, who would be confined to a monastery for the rest of their lives. \n",

      "The Saxons took advantage of Charlemagne's absence in Italy to raid the Frankish borderlands, leading to a Frankish counter-raid in the autumn of 774 and a reprisal campaign the following year.  Charlemagne was soon drawn back to Italy as Duke Hrodgaud of Friuli rebelled against him.  He quickly crushed the rebellion, distributing Hrodgaud's lands to the Franks to consolidate his rule in Lombardy.  Charlemagne wintered in Italy, consolidating his power by issuing charters and legislation and taking Lombard hostages.  Amid the 775 Saxon and Friulian campaigns, his daughter Rotrude was born in Francia. \n",

      "Returning north, Charlemagne waged another brief, destructive campaign against the Saxons in 776. This led to the submission of many Saxons, who turned over captives and lands and submitted to baptism.  In 777, Charlemagne held an assembly at Paderborn with Frankish and Saxon men; many more Saxons came under his rule, but the Saxon magnate Widukind fled to Denmark to prepare for a new rebellion. \n",

      "Also at the Paderborn assembly were representatives of dissident factions from al-Andalus (Muslim Spain). They included the son and son-in-law of Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, the former governor of Córdoba ousted by Caliph Abd al-Rahman in 756, who sought Charlemagne's support for al-Fihri's restoration. Also present was Sulayman al-Arabi, governor of Barcelona and Girona, who wanted to become part of the Frankish kingdom and receive Charlemagne's protection rather than remain under the rule of Córdoba.  Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity to strengthen the security of the kingdom's southern frontier and extend his influence, agreed to intervene.  Crossing the Pyrenees, his army found little resistance until an ambush by Basque forces in 778 at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. The Franks, defeated in the battle, withdrew with most of their army intact. \n",

Again, Saxons had seized on the king's absence to raid. Charlemagne sent an army to Saxony in 779  while he held assemblies, legislated, and addressed a famine in Francia.  Hildegard gave birth to another daughter, Bertha.  Charlemagne returned to Saxony in 780, holding assemblies at which he received hostages from Saxon nobles and oversaw their baptism. \n",

      "He and Hildegard travelled with their four younger children to Rome in the spring of 781, leaving Pepin and Charles at Worms, to make a journey first requested by Adrian in 775.  Adrian baptised Carloman and renamed him Pepin, a name he shared with his half-brother.  Louis and the newly renamed Pepin were then anointed and crowned. Pepin was appointed king of the Lombards, and Louis king of Aquitaine.  This act was not nominal, since the young kings were sent to live in their kingdoms under the care of regents and advisers.  A delegation from the Byzantine Empire, the remnant of the Roman Empire in the East, met Charlemagne during his stay in Rome; Charlemagne agreed to betroth his daughter Rotrude to Empress Irene's son, Emperor Constantine VI. \n",

After the royal family's return to Francia, she had her final pregnancy and died from its complications on 30 April 783. The child, named after her, died shortly thereafter.  Charlemagne commissioned epitaphs for his wife and daughter, and arranged for a Mass to be said daily at Hildegard's tomb.  Charlemagne's mother Bertrada died shortly after Hildegard, on 12 July 783.  Charlemagne was remarried to Fastrada, daughter of the East Frankish count Radolf, by the end of the year. \n",

Charlemagne came to Verden after learning of the defeat, but Widukind fled before his arrival. Charlemagne summoned the Saxon magnates to an assembly and compelled them to turn prisoners over to him, since he regarded their previous acts as treachery. The annals record that Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxon prisoners beheaded in the massacre of Verden.  Fried writes, \"Although this figure may be exaggerated, the basic truth of the event is not in doubt\",  and Alessandro Barbero calls it \"perhaps the greatest stain on his reputation.\"  Charlemagne issued the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae, probably in the immediate aftermath of (or as a precursor of) the massacre.  With a harsh set of laws which included the death penalty for pagan practices, the Capitulatio \"constituted a program for the forced conversion of the Saxons\"  and was \"aimed ... at suppressing Saxon identity\". \n",

Concentrating first in Westphalia in 783, he pushed into Thuringia in 784 as his son Charles the Younger continued operations in the west. At each stage of the campaigns, the Frankish armies seized wealth and carried Saxon captives into slavery.  Unusually, Charlemagne campaigned through the winter instead of resting his army.  By 785, he had suppressed the Saxon resistance and completely commanded Westphalia. That summer, he met Widukind and persuaded him to end his resistance.

Duke Arechis fled to a fortified position at Salerno before offering Charlemagne his fealty. Charlemagne accepted his submission and hostages, who included Arechis's son Grimoald.  In Italy, Charlemagne also met with envoys from Constantinople. Empress Irene had called the 787 Second Council of Nicaea, but did not inform Charlemagne or invite any Frankish bishops.

Before his plans could be finalised, Aldechis and his elder son Romuald died of illness within weeks of each other.  Charlemagne sent Grimoald back to Benevento to serve as duke and return it to Frankish suzerainty.  The Byzantine army invaded, but were repulsed by the Frankish and Lombard forces. \n",

Bavaria was ruled by Duke Tassilo, Charlemagne's first cousin, who had been installed by Pepin the Short in 748.  Tassilo's sons were also grandsons of Desiderius, and a potential threat to Charlemagne's rule in Lombardy.  The neighbouring rulers had a growing rivalry throughout their reigns, but had sworn oaths of peace to each other in 781.  In 784, Rotpert (Charlemagne's viceroy in Italy) accused Tassilo of conspiring with Widukind in Saxony and unsuccessfully attacked the Bavarian city of Bolzano.  Charlemagne gathered his forces to prepare for an invasion of Bavaria in 787. Dividing the army, the Franks launched a three-pronged attack. Quickly realizing his poor position, Tassilo agreed to surrender and recognise Charlemagne as his overlord.  The following year, Tassilo was accused of plotting with the Avars to attack Charlemagne. He was deposed and sent to a monastery, and Charlemagne absorbed Bavaria into his kingdom.  Charlemagne spent the next few years based in Regensburg, largely focused on consolidating his rule of Bavaria and warring against the Avars.  Successful campaigns against them were launched from Bavaria and Italy in 788,  and Charlemagne led campaigns in 791 and 792. \n",

In 792, as his father and brothers were gathered in Regensburg, Pepin conspired with Bavarian nobles to assassinate them and install himself as king. The plot was discovered and revealed to Charlemagne before it could proceed; Pepin was sent to a monastery, and many of his co-conspirators were executed. \n",

The council condemned adoptionism as heresy and led to the production of the Libri Carolini, a detailed argument against Nicea's canons.  In 794, Charlemagne called another council in Frankfurt.  The council confirmed Regensburg's positions on adoptionism and Nicea, recognised the deposition of Tassilo, set grain prices, reformed Frankish coinage, forbade abbesses from blessing men, and endorsed prayer in vernacular languages.  Soon after the council, Fastrada fell ill and died;  Charlemagne married the Alamannian noblewoman Luitgard shortly afterwards.  \n",

The campaigns of the 790s were even more destructive than those of earlier decades, with the annal writers frequently noting Charlemagne \"burning\", \"ravaging\", \"devastating\", and \"laying waste\" the Saxon lands.  Charlemagne forcibly removed a large number of Saxons to Francia, installing Frankish elites and soldiers in their place.  His extended wars in Saxony led to his establishing his court in Aachen, which had easy access to the frontier. He built a large palace there, including a chapel which is now part of the Aachen Cathedral.  Einhard joined the court at that time.  Pepin of Italy (Carloman) engaged in further wars against the Avars in the south, which led to the collapse of their kingdom and the eastward expansion of Frankish rule. \n",

Charles the Younger proposed a marriage pact with the daughter of King Offa of Mercia, but Offa insisted that Charlemagne's daughter Bertha also be given as a bride for his son.  Charlemagne refused the arrangement, and the marriage did not take place.  Charlemagne and Offa entered into a formal peace in 796, protecting trade and securing the rights of English pilgrims to pass through Francia on their way to Rome.  Charlemagne was also the host and protector of several deposed English rulers who were later restored: Eadbehrt of Kent, Ecgberht, King of Wessex, and Eardwulf of Northumbria.   Nelson writes that Charlemagne treated the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms \"like satellite states,\" establishing direct relations with English bishops.  Charlemagne also forged an alliance with Alfonso II of Asturias, although Einhard calls Alfonso his \"dependent\".

His enemies accused him of a number of crimes and physically attacked him in April 799, attempting to remove his eyes and tongue.  Leo escaped and fled north to seek Charlemagne's help.  Charlemagne continued his campaign against the Saxons before breaking off to meet Leo at Paderborn in September.   Hearing evidence from the pope and his enemies, he sent Leo back to Rome with royal legates who were instructed to reinstate the pope and conduct a further investigation.  In August of the following year, Charlemagne made plans to go to Rome after an extensive tour of his lands in Neustria.   Charlemagne met Leo in November near Mentana at the twelfth milestone outside Rome, the traditional location where Roman emperors began their formal entry into the city.  Charlemagne presided over an assembly to hear the charges, but believed that no one could sit in judgement of the pope. Leo swore an oath on 23 December, declaring his innocence of all charges.  At mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Christmas Day 800, Leo proclaimed Charlemagne \"emperor of the Romans\" (Imperator Romanorum) and crowned him. Charlemagne was the first reigning emperor in the west since the deposition of Romulus Augustulus in 476.  His son, Charles the Younger, was anointed king by Leo at the same time. \n",

      "Historians differ about the intentions of the imperial coronation, the extent to which Charlemagne was aware of it or participated in its planning, and the significance of the events for those present and for Charlemagne's reign.  Contemporary Frankish and papal sources differ in their emphasis on, and representation of, events.  Einhard writes that Charlemagne would not have entered the church if he knew about the pope's plan; modern historians have regarded his report as truthful or rejected it as a literary device demonstrating Charlemagne's humility.  Collins says that the actions surrounding the coronation indicate that it was planned by Charlemagne as early as his meeting with Leo in 799,  and Fried writes that Charlemagne planned to adopt the title of emperor by 798 \"at the latest.\"  During the years before the coronation, Charlemagne's courtier Alcuin referred to his realm as an Imperium Christianum (\"Christian Empire\") in which \"just as the inhabitants of the Roman Empire had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", the new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.  This is the view of Henri Pirenne, who says that \"Charles was the Emperor of the ecclesia as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\". \n",

      "The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire remained a significant contemporary power in European politics for Leo and Charlemagne, especially in Italy. The Byzantines continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with their borders not far south of Rome. Empress Irene had seized the throne from her son Constantine VI in 797, deposing and blinding him.  Irene, the first Byzantine empress, faced opposition in Constantinople because of her gender and her means of accession.  One of the earliest narrative sources for the coronation, the Annals of Lorsch, presented a female ruler in Constantinople as a vacancy in the imperial title which justified Leo's coronation of Charlemagne.  Pirenne disagrees, saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople.\"  Leo's main motivations may have been the desire to increase his standing after his political difficulties, placing himself as a power broker and securing Charlemagne as a powerful ally and protector.  The Byzantine Empire's lack of ability to influence events in Italy and support the papacy were also important to Leo's position.  According to the Royal Frankish Annals, Leo prostrated himself before Charlemagne after crowning him (an act of submission standard in Roman coronation rituals from the time of Diocletian). This account presents Leo not as Charlemagne's superior, but as the agent of the Roman people who acclaimed Charlemagne as emperor. \n",

      "Historian Henry Mayr-Harting claims that the assumption of the imperial title by Charlemagne was an effort to incorporate the Saxons into the Frankish realm, since they did not have a native tradition of kingship.  However, Costambeys et al. note in The Carolingian World that \"since Saxony had not been in the Roman empire it is hard to see on what basis an emperor would have been any more welcomed.\"  These authors write that the decision to take the title of emperor was aimed at furthering Charlemagne's influence in Italy, as an appeal to traditional authority recognised by Italian elites within and (especially) outside his control. \n",
      "\n",
      "Collins also writes that becoming emperor gave Charlemagne \"the right to try to impose his rule over the whole of [Italy]\", considering this a motivation for the coronation.  He notes the \"element of political and military risk\"  inherent in the affair due to the opposition of the Byzantine Empire and potential opposition from the Frankish elite, as the imperial title could draw him further into Mediterranean politics.  Collins sees several of Charlemagne's actions as attempts to ensure that his new title had a distinctly-Frankish context. \n",

      "Charlemagne's coronation led to a centuries-long ideological conflict between his successors and Constantinople known as the problem of two emperors, which could be seen as a rejection or usurpation of the Byzantine emperors' claim to be the universal, preeminent rulers of Christendom.  Historian James Muldoon writes that Charlemagne may have had a more limited view of his role, seeing the title as representing dominion over lands he already ruled.  However, the title of emperor gave Charlemagne enhanced prestige and ideological authority.   He immediately incorporated his new title into documents he issued, adopting the formula \"Charles, most serene augustus, crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the Roman empire, and who is by the mercy of God king of the Franks and the Lombards\" instead of the earlier form \"Charles, by the grace of God king of the Franks and Lombards and patrician of the Romans.\"  Leo acclaimed Charlemagne as \"emperor of the Romans\" during the coronation, but Charlemagne never used this title.  The avoidance of the specific claim of being a \"Roman emperor\", as opposed to the more-neutral \"emperor governing the Roman empire\", may have been to improve relations with the Byzantines.   This formulation (with the continuation of his earlier royal titles) may also represent a view of his role as emperor as being the ruler of the people of the city of Rome, as he was of the Franks and the Lombards.  \n",

Continuing trends and a ruling style established in the 790s,  Charlemagne's reign from 801 onward is a \"distinct phase\"  characterised by more sedentary rule from Aachen.  Although conflict continued until the end of his reign, the relative peace of the imperial period allowed for attention on internal governance. The Franks continued to wage war, though these wars were  defending and securing the empire's frontiers,   and Charlemagne rarely led armies personally.  A significant expansion of the Spanish March was achieved with a series of campaigns by Louis against the Emirate of Cordoba, culminating in the 801 capture of Barcelona. \n",

According to the contemporary Byzantine chronicler Thophanes, Charlemagne made an offer of marriage to Irene which she was close to accepting.  Irene was deposed and replaced by Nikephoros I, who was unwilling to recognise Charlemagne as emperor.  The two empires conflicted over control of the Adriatic Sea (especially Istria and Veneto) several times during Nikephoros' reign. Charlemagne sent envoys to Constantinople in 810 to make peace, giving up his claims to Veneto. Nikephoros died in battle before the envoys could leave Constantinople but his son-in-law and successor Michael I confirmed the peace, sending his own envoys to Aachen to recognise Charlemagne as emperor.

As an early sign of friendship, Charlemagne requested an elephant as a gift from Harun. Harun later provided an elephant named Abul-Abbas, which arrived at Aachen in 802.  Harun also sought to undermine Charlemagne's relations with the Byzantines, with whom he was at war. As part of his outreach, Harun gave Charlemagne nominal rule of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and other gifts.  According to Einhard, Charlemagne \"zealously strove to make friendships with kings beyond the seas\" in order \"that he might get some help and relief to the Christians living under their rule.\" A surviving administrative document, the Basel roll, shows the work done by his agents in Palestine in furtherance of this goal. \n",

Unable to intervene directly, Charlemagne sent specially-minted coins and arms to the eastern Christians to defend and restore their churches and monasteries. The coins with their inscriptions were also an important tool of imperial propaganda.  Johannes Fried writes that deteriorating relations with Baghdad after Harun's death may have been the impetus for renewed negotiations with Constantinople which led to Charlemagne's peace with Michael in 811. \n",

      "As emperor, Charlemagne became involved in a religious dispute between Eastern and Western Christians over the recitation of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, the fundamental statement of orthodox Christian belief. The original text of the creed, adopted at the Council of Constantinople, professed that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father. A tradition developed in Western Europe that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father \"and the Son\", inserting the Latin term  into the creed.  The difference did not cause significant conflict until 807, when Frankish monks in Bethlehem were denounced as heretics by a Greek monk for using the  form.  The Frankish monks appealed the dispute to Rome, where Pope Leo affirmed the text of the creed omitting the phrase and passed the report on to Charlemagne.  Charlemagne summoned a council at Aachen in 809 which defended the use of , and sent the decision to Rome. Leo said that the Franks could maintain their tradition, but asserted that the canonical creed did not include .  He commissioned two silver shields with the creed in Latin and Greek (omitting the ), which he hung in St. Peter's Basilica.

Gudfred again attempted diplomatic overtures in 809, but no peace was apparently made.  Danish pirates raided Frisia in 810, although it is uncertain if they were connected to Gudfred.  Charlemagne sent an army to secure Frisia while he led a force against Gudfred, who had reportedly challenged the emperor to face him in battle.   The battle never took place, since Gudfred was murdered by two of his own men before Charlemagne's arrival.  Gudfred's nephew and successor Hemming immediately sued for peace, and a commission led by Charlemagne's cousin Wala reached a settlement with the Danes in 811.  The Danes did not pose a threat for the remainder of Charlemagne's reign, but the effects of this war and their earlier expansion in Saxony helped set the stage for the intense Viking raids across Europe later in the ninth century.  \n",

The deaths of Charles and Pepin of Italy left Charlemagne's earlier plans for succession in disarray. He declared Pepin of Italy's son Bernard ruler of Italy and made his own only surviving son, Louis, heir to the rest of the empire.  Charlemagne also made a new will detailing the disposal of his property at his death, with bequests to the church, his children, and his grandchildren.  Einhard (possibly relying on tropes from Suetonius's The Twelve Caesars) says that Charlemagne viewed the deaths of his family members, his fall from a horse, astronomical phenomena, and the collapse of part of the palace in his last years as signs of his impending death.  Charlemagne continued to govern with energy during his final year, ordering bishops to assemble in five ecclesiastical councils.

Middle Francia was divided several more times over the course of subsequent generations.  Carolingians would rulewith some interruptionsin East Francia (later the Kingdom of Germany) until 911,  and in West Francia (which would become France) until 987.  After 887, the imperial title was held sporadically by a series of non-dynastic Italian rulers  before it lapsed in 924.  The East Frankish king Otto the Great conquered Italy, and was crowned emperor in 962.   By this time, the eastern and western parts of Charlemagne's former empire had already developed distinct languages and cultures.

The marriage of Philip II of France to Isabella of Hainault (a direct descendant of Charlemagne) was seen as a sign of increased legitimacy for their son, Louis VIII, and the French kings' association with Charlemagne's legacy was stressed until the monarchy's end.

      "Contacts with the wider Mediterranean world through Spain and Italy, the influx of foreign scholars at court, and the relative stability and length of Charlemagne's reign led to a cultural revival known as the Carolingian Renaissance.  Although the beginnings of this revival can be seen under his predecessors, Charles Martel and Pepin, Charlemagne took an active and direct role in shaping intellectual life which led to the revival's zenith.  Charlemagne promoted learning as a matter of policy and direct patronage, with the aim of creating a more effective clergy.  The Admonitio generalis and Epistola de litteris colendis outlined his policies and aims for education. \n",

      "Intellectual life at court was dominated by Irish, Anglo-Saxon, Visigothic and Italian scholars, including Dungal of Bobbio, Alcuin of York, Theodulf of Orléans, and Peter of Pisa; Franks such as Einhard and Angelbert also made substantial contributions.  Aside from the intellectual activity at the palace, Charlemagne promoted ecclesiastical schools and publicly funded schools for the children of the elite and future clergy.  Students learned basic Latin literacy and grammar, arithmetic, and other subjects of the medieval liberal arts.  From their education, it was expected that even rural priests could provide their parishioners with basic instruction in religious matters and (possibly) the literacy required for worship.  Latin was standardised and its use brought into territories well beyond the former Roman Empire, forming a second language community of speakers and writers and sustaining Latin creativity in the Middle Ages. \n",

The Carolingian period also saw a revival of the mirrors for princes genre.  The author of the Latin poem Visio Karoli Magni, written , uses facts (apparently from Einhard) and his own observations on the decline of Charlemagne's family after their civil wars later in the ninth century as the bases of a visionary tale about Charles meeting a prophetic spectre in a dream.

      "Charlemagne, as a figure of myth and emulation, grew over the centuries; Matthias Becher writes that over 1,000 legends are recorded about him, far outstripping subsequent emperors and kings.  Later medieval writers depicted Charlemagne as a crusader and Christian warrior.   Charlemagne is the main figure of the medieval literary cycle known as the Matter of France. Works in this cycle, which originated during the Crusades, centre on characterisations of the emperor as a leader of Christian knights in wars against Muslims. The cycle includes  (epic poems) such as the Song of Roland and chronicles such as the Historia Caroli Magni, also known as the (Pseudo-)Turpin Chronicle.   Charlemagne was depicted as one of the Nine Worthies, a fixture in medieval literature and art as an exemplar of a Christian king.  Despite his central role in these legends, author Thomas Bulfinch noted that \"romancers represent him as often weak and passionate, the victim of treacherous counsellors, and at the mercy of turbulent barons, on whose prowess he depends for the maintenance of his throne.\" \n",

As early as the sixteenth century, debate between German and French writers began about Charlemagne's \"nationality\".  These contrasting portraits—a French Charlemagne versus a German Karl der Große—became especially pronounced during the nineteenth century with Napoleon's use of Charlemagne's legacy and the rise of German nationalism.   German historiography and popular perception focused on the Massacre of Verden, emphasised with Charlemagne as the \"butcher\" of the Germanic Saxons or downplayed as an unfortunate part of the legacy of a great German ruler.  Propaganda in Nazi Germany initially portrayed Charlemagne as an enemy of Germany, a French ruler who worked to take away the freedom and native religion of the German people.  This quickly shifted as Adolf Hitler endorsed a portrait of Charlemagne as a great unifier of disparate German tribes into a common nation, allowing Hitler to co-opt Charlemagne's legacy as an ideological model for his expansionist policies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Historiography after World War II focused on Charlemagne as \"the father of Europe\" rather than a nationalistic figure,  a view first advanced during the nineteenth century by German romantic philosopher Friedrich Schlegel.  This view has led to Charlemagne's adoption as a political symbol of European integration.  Modern historians increasingly place Charlemagne in the context of the wider Mediterranean world, following the work of Henri Pirenne. \n",

      "Charlemagne gave much attention to religious and ecclesiastical affairs, holding 23 synods during his reign. His synods were called to address specific issues at particular times, but generally dealt with church administration and organisation, education of the clergy, and the proper forms of liturgy and worship.  Charlemagne used the Christian faith as a unifying factor in the realm and, in turn, worked to impose unity on the church.   He implemented an edited version of the Dionysio-Hadriana book of canon law acquired from Pope Adrian, required use of the Rule of St. Benedict in monasteries throughout the empire, and promoted a standardised liturgy adapted from the rites of the Roman Church to conform with Frankish practices.  Carolingian policies promoting unity did not eliminate the diverse practices throughout the empire, but created a shared ecclesiastical identity—according to Rosamond McKitterick, \"unison, not unity.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The condition of all his subjects as a \"Christian people\" was an important concern.  Charlemagne's policies encouraged preaching to the laity, particularly in vernacular languages they would understand.  He believed it essential to be able to recite the Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, and made efforts to ensure that the clergy taught them and other basics of Christian morality. \n",
      "\n",
      "ThomasF.X.Noble writes that the efforts of Charlemagne and his successors to standardise Christian doctrine and practices and harmonise Frankish practices were essential steps in the development of Christianity in Europe, and the Roman Catholic or Latin Church \"as a historical phenomenon, not as a theological or ecclesiological one, is a Carolingian construction.\"   He says that the medieval European concept of Christendom as an overarching community of Western Christians, rather than a collection of local traditions, is the result of Carolingian policies and ideology.  Charlemagne's doctrinal policies promoting the use of  and opposing the Second Council of Nicea were key steps in the growing divide between Western and Eastern Christianity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Emperor Otto III attempted to have Charlemagne canonised in 1000.  In 1165, Frederick Barbarossa persuaded Antipope Paschal III to elevate Charlemagne to sainthood.  Since Paschal's acts were not considered valid, Charlemagne was not recognised as a saint by the Holy See.  Despite this lack of official recognition, his cult was observed in Aachen, Reims, Frankfurt, Zurich and Regensburg, and he has been venerated in France since the reign of Charles V. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne also drew attention from figures of the Protestant Reformation, with Martin Luther criticising his apparent subjugation to the papacy by accepting his coronation from Leo.  John Calvin and other Protestant thinkers viewed him as a forerunner of the Reformation, however, noting the Libri Carolini condemnation of the worship of images and relics and conflicts by Charlemagne and his successors with the temporal power of the popes. \n",

A 2010 estimate of his height from an X-ray and CT scan of his tibia was ; this puts him in the 99th percentile of height for his period, given that average male height of his time was . The width of the bone suggested that he was slim. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charlemagne wore his hair short, abandoning the Merovingian tradition of long-haired monarchs.  He had a moustache (possibly imitating the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great), in contrast with the bearded Merovingian kings;  future Carolingian monarchs would adopt this style.  Paul Dutton notes the ubiquitous crown in portraits of Charlemagne and other Carolingian rulers, replacing the earlier Merovingian long hair.  A ninth-century statuette depicts Charlemagne or his grandson, Charles the Bald and shows the subject as moustachioed with short hair;  this also appears on contemporary coinage. \n",

      "By the twelfth century, Charlemagne was described as bearded rather than moustachioed in literary sources such as the Song of Roland, the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle, and other works in Latin, French, and German.  The Pseudo-Turpin'' uniquely says that his hair was brown.  Later art and iconography of Charlemagne followed suit, generally depicting him in a later medieval style as bearded with longer hair. \n",

She was the great-granddaughter of Augustus (the first Roman emperor) and the daughter of the Roman general Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder. Her father, Germanicus, was the nephew and heir apparent of the second emperor, Tiberius. Agrippina\\'s brother Caligula became emperor in AD 37. After Caligula was assassinated in AD 41, Germanicus\\' brother Claudius took the throne. Agrippina married Claudius in AD 49.\\n\\nAgrippina has been described by modern and ancient sources as ruthless, ambitious, domineering and using her powerful political ties to influence the affairs of the Roman state, even managing to successfully maneuver her son Nero into the line of succession. Claudius eventually became aware of her plotting, but died in AD 54 under suspicious circumstances, potentially poisoned by Agrippina herself.  She exerted significant political influence in the early years of her son\\'s reign, but eventually fell out of favor with him and was killed in AD 59. Physically, Agrippina was described as a beautiful and reputable woman; and, according to Pliny the Elder, had a double canine in her upper right jaw, which was regarded as a sign of good fortune in Ancient Rome.\\n\\nSection: Family\\n\\nAgrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of Agrippina the Elder and Germanicus. \\n\\nShe had three elder brothers, Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, and the future emperor Caligula, and two younger sisters, Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla. Agrippina\\'s two eldest brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the Praetorian Prefect Lucius Aelius Sejanus.\\n\\nShe was the namesake of her mother. Agrippina the Elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron, who was the second daughter and fourth child of Julia the Elder and the statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The father of Julia the Elder was the emperor Augustus, and Julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to Scribonia, who had close blood relations with Pompey the Great and Lucius Cornelius Sulla.\\n\\nGermanicus, Agrippina\\'s father, was a very popular general and politician. His mother was Antonia Minor and his father was the general Nero Claudius Drusus. He was Antonia Minor\\'s first child. Germanicus had two younger siblings: Livilla and Claudius, making the pair Agrippina\\'s aunt and uncle, respectively. Not only would Claudius later serve as Roman emperor, he would also go on to take Agrippina, his own niece, as his wife.\\n\\nAntonia Minor was a daughter to Octavia the Younger by her second marriage to triumvir Mark Antony, and Octavia was the second eldest sister and full-blooded sister of Augustus. Germanicus\\' father, Drusus the Elder, was the second son of the Empress Livia Drusilla by her first marriage to praetor Tiberius Nero, and was the emperor Tiberius\\'s younger brother and Augustus\\'s stepson.\\n\\nIn the year AD 9, Augustus ordered Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, who happened to be Tiberius\\'s nephew, as his son and heir. Germanicus was a favourite of Augustus, who hoped that he would succeed Tiberius, who was Augustus\\'s adopted son and heir and then emperor following Augustus\\' death in AD 14. This in turn meant that Tiberius was also Agrippina\\'s adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great-uncle.\\n\\nSection: Birth and early life\\n\\nAgrippina was born on 6 November in AD 15, or possibly AD 14, at Oppidum Ubiorum, a Roman outpost on the Rhine River located in present-day Cologne, Germany.  A second sister Julia Drusilla was born on 16 September AD 16, also in Germany. \\n\\nAgrippina\\'s place of birth is disputed, with Cologne being seen as a likely place considering how Agrippina would favor the city and the Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium being established at her prompting there.\\n\\nSuetonius however claims that both of Germanicus\\'s eldest daughters were born in Trier in Gaul.  \\n\\nAs a small child, Agrippina travelled with her parents throughout Germany until she and her siblings (apart from Caligula) returned to Rome to live with and be raised by their paternal grandmother Antonia.  Her parents departed for Syria in AD 18 to conduct official duties, and, according to Tacitus, the third and youngest sister was born en route on the island of Lesbos, namely Julia Livilla, probably on 18 March.  In October of AD 19, Germanicus died suddenly in Antioch (present-day Antakya, Turkey).\\n\\nGermanicus\\' death caused much public grief in Rome, and gave rise to rumours that he had been murdered by Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso and Munatia Plancina on the orders of Tiberius, as his widow Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with his ashes. Agrippina the Younger was thereafter supervised by her mother, her paternal grandmother Antonia Minor, and her great-grandmother, Livia. She lived on the Palatine Hill in Rome. \\n\\nSection: Marriage to Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus\\n\\n(image caption: Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus)\\n\\n|290x290px\\nAfter her thirteenth birthday in AD 28, Tiberius arranged for Agrippina to marry her paternal first cousin once removed Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in Rome.  Domitius came from a distinguished family of consular rank. Through his mother Antonia Major, Domitius was a great nephew of Augustus, first cousin to Claudius, and first cousin once removed to Agrippina and Caligula. He had two sisters; Domitia Lepida the Elder and Domitia Lepida the Younger. Domitia Lepida the Younger was the mother of the Empress Valeria Messalina.\\n\\nAntonia Major was the elder sister to Antonia Minor, and the first daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. Domitius, who was, according to Suetonius, \"in every aspect of his life detestable,\" served as consul in AD 32. Agrippina and Domitius lived between Antium and Rome. Not much is known about the relationship between them.\\n\\nSection: Reign of Caligula\\n\\n(image caption: During the reign of Caligula)\\n\\n, coins like the one pictured here were issued depicting his three sisters, Drusilla, Livilla, and Agrippina the Younger.\\n\\nSubsection: Public role and political intrigues\\n\\nTiberius died on 16 March AD 37, and Agrippina\\'s only surviving brother, Caligula, became the new emperor. Being the emperor\\'s sister gave Agrippina some influence.\\n\\nAgrippina and her younger sisters Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla received various honours from their brother, which included but were not limited to\\n\\n receiving the rights of the Vestal Virgins, such as the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium;\\n being honoured with a new type of coinage, depicting images of Caligula and his sisters on opposite faces;\\n having their names added to motions, including loyalty oaths (e.g., \"I will not value my life or that of my children less highly than I do the safety of the Emperor and his sisters\") and consular motions (e.g., \"Good fortune attend to the Emperor and his sisters)\".\\n\\nAround the time that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child. On 15 December AD 37, in the early morning, in Antium, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after Domitius\\' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the emperor Nero. Nero was Agrippina\\'s only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied \"I don\\'t think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people\".\\n\\nCaligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships. On 10 June AD 38, Drusilla died, possibly of a fever, rampant in Rome at the time. Caligula was particularly fond of Drusilla, claiming to treat her as he would his own wife, even though Drusilla had a husband. Following her death, Caligula showed no special love or respect toward the surviving sisters and was said to have gone insane.\\n\\nIn AD 39, Agrippina and Livilla, with their maternal cousin, Drusilla\\'s widower Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, were involved in a failed plot to murder Caligula, a plot known as the Plot of the Three Daggers, which was to make Lepidus the new emperor. Lepidus, Agrippina and Livilla were accused of being lovers. Not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it. At the trial of Lepidus, Caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses, producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him. The three were found guilty as accessories to the crime. \\n\\nSubsection: Exile\\n\\nLepidus was executed. According to the fragmentary inscriptions of the Arval Brethren, Agrippina was forced to carry the urn of Lepidus\\' ashes back to Rome.  Agrippina and Livilla were exiled by their brother to the Ponza, in Pontine Islands, an archipelago of small volcanic islands about 70 miles away from Rome.\\n\\nCaligula sold their furniture, jewellery, slaves and freedmen.  In January of AD 40, Domitius died of edema (dropsy) at Pyrgi. Lucius had gone to live with his second paternal aunt Domitia Lepida the Younger after Caligula had taken his inheritance away from him.\\n\\nCaligula, his wife Milonia Caesonia and their daughter Julia Drusilla were murdered on 24 January AD 41. Agrippina\\'s paternal uncle, Claudius, brother of her father Germanicus, became the new Roman emperor.\\n\\nSection: Reign of Claudius\\n\\nSubsection: Return from exile\\n\\n(image caption: Messalina)\\n\\n holding her son Britannicus (Louvre)\\nClaudius lifted the exiles of Agrippina and Livilla. Livilla returned to her husband, while Agrippina was reunited with her estranged son. After the death of her first husband, Agrippina tried to make shameless advances on the future emperor Galba. He showed no interest, being devoted to his wife Aemilia Lepida. On one occasion, Galba\\'s mother-in-law gave Agrippina a public reprimand and a slap in the face before a whole bevy of married women. \\n\\nClaudius had Lucius\\' inheritance reinstated. Lucius became more wealthy despite his youth shortly after Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus divorced Lucius\\' aunt, Domitia Lepida the Elder (Lucius\\' first paternal aunt) so that Crispus could marry Agrippina. They married, and Crispus  became a step-father to Lucius. Crispus was an influential, wealthy and powerful man who served twice as consul. He was the adopted grandson and biological great-great-nephew of the historian Sallust. Little is known about their relationship, but Crispus soon died and left his estate to Nero.\\n\\nDuring the first years his reign, Claudius was married to the Empress Valeria Messalina. Messalina was Agrippina\\'s paternal second cousin. Among the victims of Messalina\\'s intrigues were Agrippina\\'s surviving sister Livilla, who was charged with adultery with Seneca the Younger. Although Agrippina was very influential at this time, she kept a low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor.\\n\\nMessalina considered Agrippina\\'s son a threat to her son\\'s position and sent assassins to strangle Lucius during his siesta. The assassins left after they saw a snake beneath Lucius\\' pillow, considering it a bad omen.  It was, however, only a sloughed-off snake-skin. By Agrippina\\'s order, the serpent\\'s skin was enclosed in a bracelet that the young Lucius wore on his right arm. \\n\\nIn AD 47, Crispus died. At his funeral, a rumour spread that Agrippina had poisoned Crispus to gain his estate. After being widowed a second time, Agrippina was left very wealthy. Later that year, Messalina and Britannicus attended the performance of the Troy Pageant at the Secular Games, where Agrippina was also present with Lucius. Agrippina and Lucius received greater applause from the audience than Messalina and Britannicus did. Many people began to show pity and sympathy to Agrippina, due to the unfortunate circumstances of her life. \\n\\nSubsection: Marriage to Claudius\\n\\nMessalina was executed in AD 48 for conspiring with Gaius Silius to overthrow her husband. Around this time, Agrippina became the mistress to one of Claudius\\' advisers, the Greek freedman Marcus Antonius Pallas. After ending his marriage, Claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time and his advisers began discussing which noblewoman he should marry. Claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded; but it has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage between Agrippina and Claudius to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.  This feud dated back to Agrippina\\'s mother\\'s actions against Tiberius after the death of Germanicus. Another reason was to bring in Agrippina\\'s son, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, as a candidate for the succession. His prestige as the descendent of Augustus and Germanicus would have helped the survival of Claudius\\' regime. \\n\\nClaudius was said to have made references to her in his speeches: \"my daughter and foster child, born and bred, in my lap, so to speak\".  When Claudius decided to marry her, he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest. In Roman society, an uncle (Claudius) marrying his niece (Agrippina) was considered incestuous and immoral. \\n\\nAgrippina and Claudius married on New Year\\'s Day in AD 49 and the marriage was met with widespread disapproval. Agrippina\\'s marriage to Claudius was not based on love, but powerpossibly being a part of her plan to make her son Lucius the new emperor. Shortly after marrying Claudius, Agrippina eliminated her rival Lollia Paulina by persuading Claudius to charge Paulina with allegations of black magic use. Claudius stipulated that Paulina did not receive a hearing and her property was confiscated. She left Italy, but Agrippina was unsatisfied. Allegedly on Agrippina\\'s orders, a tribune forced Lollia Paulina to commit suicide. \\n\\nIn the months leading up to her marriage to Claudius, Agrippina\\'s maternal second cousin, the praetor Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, was betrothed to Claudius\\' daughter Claudia Octavia. This betrothal was broken off in AD 48, when Agrippina, scheming with the consul Lucius Vitellius the Elder, the father of the future emperor Aulus Vitellius, falsely accused Silanus of incest with his sister Junia Calvina. Agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between Octavia and her son. Consequently, Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office. \\n\\nSilanus committed suicide on the day that Agrippina married her uncle, and Calvina was exiled from Italy in early AD 49. Calvina was called back from exile after the death of Agrippina. Towards the end of AD 54, Agrippina would order the murder of Silanus\\' eldest brother Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus without Nero\\'s knowledge, so that he would not seek revenge against her over his brother\\'s death.\\n\\nSubsection: Empress\\n\\n(image caption: Denarius)\\n\\n of Agrippina and Claudius, minted in AD 50–54. She was the first Roman empress to be depicted on official Roman coins in an unambiguous manner \\n\\nAgrippina became empress in AD 49 upon marrying her uncle Claudius. She also became stepmother to Claudia Antonia, Claudius\\' daughter and only child from his second marriage to Aelia Paetina; and to the young Claudia Octavia and Britannicus, Claudius\\' children with Valeria Messalina. Agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court whom she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late Messalina. She also eliminated or removed anyone whom she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Lucius\\' second paternal aunt and Messalina\\'s mother Domitia Lepida the Younger.\\n\\nGriffin describes how Agrippina \"had achieved this dominant position for her son and herself by a web of political alliances,\" which included Claudius chief secretary and bookkeeper Pallas, his doctor Xenophon, and Afranius Burrus: the head of the Praetorian Guard (the imperial bodyguard), who owed his promotion to Agrippina. Neither ancient nor modern historians of Rome have doubted that Agrippina had her eye on securing the throne for Nero from the very day of the marriageif not earlier. Dio Cassius observation seems to bear that out: \"As soon as Agrippina had come to live in the palace she gained complete control over Claudius.\"\\n\\nIn AD 49, Agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the Celtic King Caratacus bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor.  In AD 50, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of Augusta. She was third Roman woman (after Livia Drusilla and Antonia Minor) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Livia) to receive this title.\\n\\nIn her capacity as Augusta, Agrippina quickly became a trusted advisor to Claudius, and by AD 54, she exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor. Statues of her were erected in many cities across the Empire and her face appeared on official Roman coins unambiguously, a first for a living empress.  In the Senate, her followers were advanced with public offices and governorships. She listened to the Senate from behind the scenes.  According to Cassius Dio, Agrippina was often present with Claudius in public, seated on her own platform, when he was transacting government businesses or receiving foreign ambassadors.  Pliny the Elder writes that he saw her seated beside the emperor during mock naval combats, wearing a golden cloak.  Tacitus claims that she boasted being a \"partner in the empire\".  However, this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family.\\n\\nAlso that year, Claudius founded a Roman colony and called the colony Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis or Agrippinensium, today known as Cologne, after Agrippina who was born there.  This was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In AD 51, she was given a carpentum: a ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests such as the Vestal Virgins and sacred statues. That same year she secured the appointment of Sextus Afranius Burrus as the head of the Praetorian Guard, replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, Rufrius Crispinus. \\n\\nShe assisted Claudius in administering the empire and became very wealthy and powerful. Ancient sources claim that Agrippina successfully influenced Claudius into adopting her son and making him his successor. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather in AD 50. Lucius\\' name was changed to Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus and he became Claudius\\'s adopted son, heir and recognized successor. Agrippina and Claudius betrothed Nero to his step sister Claudia Octavia, and Agrippina arranged to have Seneca the Younger return from exile to tutor the future emperor. Claudius chose to adopt Nero because of his Julian and Claudian lineage. \\n\\nAgrippina deprived Britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible. For instance, in AD 51, Agrippina ordered the execution of Britannicus\\' tutor Sosibius. Sosibus had confronted her, outraged by Claudius\\' adoption of Nero and his choice of Nero as successor over his own son Britannicus. \\n\\nNero and Octavia were married on 9 June AD 53. Claudius later regretted marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero and began to favor Britannicus, preparing him for the throne. These actions gave Agrippina a motive to allegedly eliminate Claudius. Ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on 13 October AD 54 with a plate of deadly mushrooms at a banquet, thus enabling Nero to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident, and according to more modern sources, it is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, being 63 years old. In the aftermath of Claudius\\'s death, Agrippina, who initially kept the death secret, tried to consolidate power by immediately ordering that the palace and the capital be sealed. After all the gates were blockaded and exit of the capital forbidden, she introduced Nero first to the soldiers and then to the senators as emperor. \\n\\nSection: Reign of Nero\\n\\nSubsection: Relationship with Nero\\n\\n(image caption: Marble bust of Nero)\\n\\n. Antiquarium of the Palatine.\\nNero was raised to emperor and Agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified Claudius. She now attempted to use her son\\'s youth to participate in the rule of the Roman Empire. She enjoyed imperial prerogatives: being allowed to visit the senate meetings from behind a curtain, and appearing as a partner to her son in the official coinage and statues. The historian Tacitus depicts her as attempting a diarchy with her son when she demanded that the Praetorian Guard pledge their loyalty to her. She was also said to have tried to participate in her son\\'s meeting with Armenian ambassadors until Seneca and Burrus persuaded Nero to stop her. \\n\\n(image caption: Sculpture of Agrippina crowning her young son Nero ( AD 54–59))\\n\\nIn year one of Nero\\'s reign, Agrippina began losing influence over Nero when he began to have an affair with the freed woman Claudia Acte, which Agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for. Agrippina began to support Britannicus in her possible attempt to make him emperor, or to threaten Nero. The panicking emperor decided on whether to eliminate his mother or his step-brother. Soon, Nero had Britannicus secretly poisoned during his own banquet in February AD 55. The power struggle between Agrippina and her son had begun.  \\n\\nBetween AD 56 and 58, Agrippina became very watchful and critical of her son. In AD 56, Agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in the imperial residence. However, Agrippina retained some degree of influence over her son for several more years, and they are considered the best years of Nero\\'s reign. But, as their relationship grew more hostile, Nero gradually began to deprive his mother of honours and power, and even removed her Roman and German bodyguards. Nero even threatened his mother that he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the Greek Island of Rhodes, a place where Tiberius had lived after divorcing Julia the Elder. Pallas also was dismissed from the court. The fall of Pallas and the opposition of Burrus and Seneca to Agrippina contributed to her scaling down of authority. In mid AD 56, she was forced out of everyday and active participation in the governance of Rome. \\n\\nWhile Agrippina lived in her residence or when she went on short visits to Rome, Nero sent people to annoy her. Although living in Misenum, she was always hailed as \"Augusta\", and  Agrippina and Nero would see each other on short visits.  In late AD 58, Agrippina and a group of soldiers and senators were accused of attempting to overthrow Nero, and it was said they planned to move with Gaius Rubellius Plautus.  In addition, she revealed Nero\\'s relationship with Poppaea Sabina.\\n\\nSubsection: Death and aftermath\\n\\nThe circumstances that surround Agrippina\\'s death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti-Nero bias. However, ancient accounts agree that Nero had her murdered following an unsuccessful attempt on her life on a boat.\\n\\nSubsection: =Tacitus\\'s account\\n\\n=\\nAccording to Tacitus, in AD 58, Nero became involved with the noble woman Poppaea Sabina. She taunted him for being a \"mummy\\'s boy\". She also convinced him of the autonomy of any other emperor. With the reasoning that a divorce from Octavia and a marriage to Poppaea was not politically feasible with Agrippina alive, Nero decided to kill Agrippina.  Yet, Nero did not marry Poppaea until AD 62, calling into question this motive.   Additionally, Suetonius reveals that Poppaea\\'s husband, Otho, was not sent away by Nero until after Agrippina\\'s death in AD 59, making it highly unlikely that already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero.  Some modern historians theorise that Nero\\'s decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plot to replace him with either Gaius Rubellius Plautus (Nero\\'s maternal second cousin) or Britannicus (Claudius\\' biological son). \\n\\nTacitus claims that Nero considered poisoning or stabbing her, but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious, so he settled on – after the advice of his former tutor and freedman Anicetus – building a self-sinking boat.  Though aware of the plot, Agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a couch breaking the ceiling\\'s fall.  Though the collapsing ceiling missed Agrippina, it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm. \\n\\nThe boat failed to sink as a result of the collapse of the lead ceiling, so the crew then sank the boat, but Agrippina swam to shore.  News of Agrippina\\'s survival reached Nero so he asked Seneca and Burrus for the advice. After a moment of silence, they recommended Anicetus to carry out the act, since the Praetorians were loyal to the children of Germanicus. So Nero sent Anicetus, the trierach Herculeius, and the marine centurion Obaritus, as well as an \"armed and menacing column\" to kill her. \\n\\nAfter surrounding the villa, which scared away Agrippina\\'s supporters, they eventually made their way to the bedroom. After the last slave girl departed her side, (whom she asked \"Are you too deserting me?\"), Agrippina was surrounded in her bed and struck in the head with a cudgel, before proffering her womb, crying out \"Stab my belly!\" and finally dying after experiencing many fatal wounds to that area.  This narrative is clearly presented similarly to that of Julius Caesar, and her last act being to ensure violence upon her womb implies it was a symbolic act against her womb\\'s only progeny: the man who had ordered her death.\\n\\nSubsection: =Suetonius\\'s account\\n\\n=\\nSuetonius says that Agrippina\\'s \"over-watchful\" and \"over-critical\" eye that she kept over Nero drove him to murdering her. After months of attempting to humiliate her by depriving her of her power, honour, and bodyguards, he also expelled her from the Palatine, followed by the people he sent to \"pester\" her with lawsuits and \"jeers and catcalls\".\\n\\nWhen he eventually turned to murder, he first tried poison, three times in fact. She prevented her death by taking the antidote in advance. Afterwards, he rigged up a machine in her room which would drop her ceiling tiles onto her as she slept, but she once again escaped death after she received word of the plan. Nero\\'s final plan was to get her in a boat which would collapse and sink.\\n\\nHe sent her a friendly letter asking to reconcile and inviting her to celebrate the Quinquatrus at Baiae with him. He arranged an \"accidental\" collision between her galley and one of his captains. When returning home, he offered her his collapsible boat, as opposed to her damaged galley.\\n\\nThe day after the boat sank, Nero received word of her survival from her freedman Agermus. Panicking, Nero ordered a guard to \"surreptitiously\" drop a blade behind Agermus and Nero immediately had him arrested on a charge of attempted murder. Nero ordered the assassination of Agrippina. He made it look as if Agrippina had committed suicide after her plot to kill Nero had been uncovered.\\n\\nSuetonius says that after Agrippina\\'s death, Nero examined Agrippina\\'s corpse and discussed her good and bad points. Nero also believed Agrippina would haunt him after her death. \\n\\nSubsection: =Cassius Dio\\'s account\\n\\nChapter: The tale of Cassius Dio is also somewhat different. It starts again with Poppaea and Seneca as the motive behind the murder.  Nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea.Cassius Dio, Historia Romana LXIII.12. Then he pretended to reconcile with Agrippina and put her aboard on the vessel. Once the bottom of the ship opened up, she fell into the water.  However, the sailors ended up killing Acerronia Polla instead and Agrippina swam to shore.  Pretending to ignore the conspiracy, she sent Nero a letter informing of her well-being, so Nero sent Anicetus to kill her. Her reputed last words, uttered as the assassin was about to strike, were \"Strike here, Anicetus, strike here, for this bore Nero\".  \\n\\nNero then told the Senate that Agrippina had plotted to kill him and committed suicide. \\n\\nSubsection: =Burial\\n\\nChapter: After Agrippina\\'s death, Nero viewed her corpse and, according to some, commented how beautiful she was.Tacitus, Annals XIV.9.  Her body was cremated that night on a dining couch. At his mother\\'s funeral, Nero was witless, speechless and rather scared. When the news spread that Agrippina had died, the Roman army, senate, and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had been saved from his mother\\'s plots.\\n\\nSubsection: =Aftermath\\n\\nChapter: During the remainder of Nero\\'s reign, Agrippina\\'s grave was not covered or enclosed. Her household later on gave her a modest tomb in Misenum. Nero would have his mother\\'s death on his conscience. He felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares of her, even seeing his mother\\'s ghost and getting Persian magicians to ask her for forgiveness.  Years before she died, Agrippina had visited astrologers to ask about her son\\'s future. The astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her. She replied, \"Let him kill me, provided he becomes emperor,\" according to Tacitus. \\n\\nSubsection: == Agrippina\\'s alleged victims\\n\\nChapter: \\n\\n 47\\n Passienus Crispus: Agrippina\\'s 2nd husband, poisoned (Suet.).\\n 49\\n Lollia Paulina: as she was a rival for Claudius\\' hand in marriage as proposed by the freedman Callistus (Tac. & Dio).\\n Lucius Silanus: betrothed to Octavia, Claudius\\' daughter, before his marriage of Agrippina.
