help me create a new app with svelte and vite.

The app will live in this current directory (not a subdirectory). 

The app will have a map component used to display a map that takes the whole screen.

The map component will use leaftlet.js

The map component will have a "markers" parameter with a list of markers to pinpoint on the map.
